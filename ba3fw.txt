In my undergraduate studies, I designed a microcontroller based smart room control  
system. The system turns on the desired electric device based on the entrance of  
someone inside the room. On the other side, if there is nobody inside the room, the  
desired devices automatically get turned off. I used ATMEGA32 microcontroller and the  
program was written in C.

In my MS I took a computer architecture course. I am familiar with C/C++, python and  
linux environment.

I would like to get hands on experience in doing project on embedded system and I also  
like to extend my research in this area.
