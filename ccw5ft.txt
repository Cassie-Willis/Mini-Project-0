I took Intro to Embedded Systems last semester which was in C using
the MSP430 microcontroller and I am the lead electrical engineer 
for the Mechatronics and Robotics Society where I do embedded 
coding in the SPIN language on Parallax Propeller chips.

I am interested in robotics, embedded programming, and machine
learning/AI primarily. I hope to get more confident in embedded
programming and learn some more advanced topics in this course that 
would prepare me for a job in embedded computing.
