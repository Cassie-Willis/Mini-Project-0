My background in embedded systems is basic undergraduate classes on using
assembly and C to program PIC24 type chipsets. Also exposed to VHDL and
hardware description languages. Senior year I focused on solid state systems.

I just finished serving 5 years as an officer in the Navy. I was responsible for
various weapons, radar, and computer systems in the Navy -- so my interests are
in defense applications for new and emerging technologies in ECE. Personally I
enjoy traveling, just came back from Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand, and Mongolia.
I want to learn how to cook and dance better, maybe at the same time.
