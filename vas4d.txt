I have worked more recently with STM32F407VG (ARM M4) for a medical device development. I also have some experience with MSP430F2274 and other low cost microcontrollers from classes and research projects. About programming languages, I've used mostly C, but I've already worked with assembler too. 
On this class I intend to learn more about RTOS and develop my skills on embedded systems design.
