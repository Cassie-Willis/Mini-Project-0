I took the course "Fundamentals of Embedded System Design" in my undergrad. And my final undergrad project was to design a tactile display which is appiled to visually impaired people. In this project I designed a circuit including a straightforward embedded system on my own and participated in part of the software programming on Keil IDE. Currently I am working in Professor Calhoun's group, coding on CCS IDE for the microprocessor MSP430. The programming language I am using is C.
I have never used ARM which has much more strong functions than other MCUs to develop an actual system. As a result, I am really looking forward to learning something useful about ARM. Besides, since I do have some experiences on other MCUs, I hope I could take advantage of my existing skills and knowledge about embedded systems to acquire more comprehensive understanding about it. To achieve this, I prefer obtaining the skills by self-directed approaches. By saying this, I mean I prefer projects rather than just information delivered in every class. I think I could improve a lot by completing an actual project by self-exploring and group collaboration.
