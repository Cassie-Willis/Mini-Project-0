Most of my embedded background comes from working with the MSP430 in Intro to
Embedded, but I've spent some time trouble-shooting systems that rely
heavily on embedded computing through my internship with
the Department of the Navy. For embedded applications, I've only programmed in C,
but for other classes/projects I've worked a lot in Java, C++, and Python.

I hope to build upon what I learned in ECE 3430 (Intro) as we work on more
complex applications, and potentially apply elements of this class towards my
interests in renewable energy and amateur radio.
